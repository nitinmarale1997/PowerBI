# Problem Statement

- **Problem:** Churning customers using PhoneNow services were got in touch after they terminated the contract, and the Customer Retention manager wants to understand their customer profile and insights with a focus on retaining customers as well as approaching in advance who is at risk.
- **Objectives:** The purpose of this analysis is to create a Customer Retention Dashboard in Power BI for the Customer Retention Manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics to:
    - Self-exploratory the customer demographics and insights (churning & retaining).
    - Actively approach who is at risk with the risk level of specific customer
    - Contain many metrics and plots related to a single area of business for discussing with higher managers and generating further analysis.
    - Allows for minimal interaction.
    - Based on finding recommend improving customer retention.


# Analysis and Insights
The purpose of this dashboard is to serve as self-exploratory for managers, but I still note some highlighted points that I recognize below:

- Month-to-Month contracts, lack of online security and tech support, and issues with Fiber Optic service are some of the reasons for customer churn.
- Only 16% of the customers are senior citizens, with almost double the churn rate compared to younger customers.
- The customers have varying contract lengths, with a lot of them only staying for a month and some for up to 72 months.
- Customers taking longer contracts tend to be more loyal and stay with the company for a longer period of time.
- Customers are more likely to churn when the monthly charges are high, and there is a higher chance of churn when the total charges are lower.
