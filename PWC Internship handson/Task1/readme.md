# Problem Statement

- **Problem:** The manager at PhoneNow (a big telecom company) is seeking transparency and insight into the Call Center dataset to gain an accurate overview of long-term customer and agent behavior trends.
- **Objective:** The purpose of this analysis is to create a dashboard in Power BI for Call Center Manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics to:
    - Self-exploratory call trends
    - Overview of the agent’s performance and behaviors
    - Overview the customer satisfaction
    - Contain many metrics and plots related to a single area of business for discussing with higher managers and generating further analysis.
    - Allows for minimal interaction

    - Overall customer satisfaction
    - Overall calls answered/abandoned
    - Calls by time
