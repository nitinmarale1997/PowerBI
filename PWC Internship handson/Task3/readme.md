# Problem Statement

- **Problem:** Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress.
- **Objective**:
    - Define proper KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover
    - Create a visualization for the HR manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance indicators(KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
    - Define some root causes of their slow progress in improving gender balance at the executive management level might be
    - Allows for minimal interaction.
   

# Analysis and Insights

The purpose of this dashboard is to serve as self-exploratory for managers, but I still note some highlighted points that I recognize that some root causes of their slow progress in improving gender balance at the executive management level might be below:

- Employees who were promoted twice within two years had very low-performance ratings, while those who left had higher ratings.
- According to the data, it appears that a significant portion of employees has been stagnating in their current job level for more than two years, despite working diligently. Promotions have not been forthcoming, female directors, in particular, require more time to be nominated as executives compared to their male counterparts.
- There is a significant gender imbalance in the distribution of new hires and promotions for executive positions, despite the fact that these female directors perform better.
- A potential factor contributing to the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level is that the performance evaluations for promotion at management levels may not be entirely objective and honest. This could result in qualified female candidates being overlooked for executive positions, despite their superior performance compared to their male counterparts.
